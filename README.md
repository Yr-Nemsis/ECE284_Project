# ECE284_Project

We provide every part of the project in its own folder. 

The verilog files setup for the execution can be found in hardware folder for each part. 

For parts 2, 3, 5 and 6 the verilog can be found at:

```
Part_2_and_3/hardware
Part5/hardware
Part6/Dual_core/hardware
Part6/Huffman/hardware
```



## Running each part in the project
We provied a make file to compile and run the design. 

To compile an execute the verilog use
```
make all 
```
VCD file will be produced after execution the testbench verifies the produced psums and the generated outputs.
